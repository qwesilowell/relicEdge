I want to refine and improve the site as follows:

Hero Section / Initial Home Page

Make the hero section visually interesting and engaging — not boring.

The typing effect works, but the text and background should feel more lively (e.g., gradient text, subtle animations, parallax glow, or smooth motion).

Ensure the hero section fills the viewport nicely, with no excessive empty space below on desktop or mobile.

CTA Buttons

Make the “Get Started” button functional: clicking it scrolls or navigates smoothly to the About section.

Make other CTA buttons functional (like the “Contact” button) instead of placeholders.

Style buttons consistently with hover effects and responsiveness.

Responsive Design

Make all sections fully responsive on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Fix excessive bottom space on mobile when scrolling — ensure each section fits content naturally.

Ensure the nav bar, hero section, cards, and forms scale properly for different screen sizes.

Navigation and Section Management

Keep the existing smooth section transitions.

Highlight the active nav link for the current section.

Close the mobile nav menu when a link is clicked.

Typing Effect

Keep the current typing effect working smoothly.

Optionally add a small subtle animation (like a blinking cursor or gradient text) to make it visually appealing.

Visual Improvements

Hero background could have soft animated glows or gradients.

About/Works/Contact sections should feel connected and visually engaging.

Ensure spacing, margins, and paddings are consistent across sections.

Additional Requirements

Use vanilla JS and CSS (no frameworks).

Ensure all interactive elements are accessible on both desktop and mobile.

Preserve the existing scrolling animations and glow effects.

Ensure no overlapping or flickering happens in mobile or small screens.

The goal is to have a modern, responsive, engaging single-page portfolio site with smooth interactions, functional buttons, visually appealing hero section, and proper spacing on all devices.
